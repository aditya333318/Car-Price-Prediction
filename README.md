# Car Price Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a **machine learning project focused on predicting car prices** using structured automotive data.  
The project emphasizes **data understanding, feature analysis, and model evaluation** rather than blindly optimizing accuracy.

---

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze key factors influencing car prices
- Build and evaluate predictive models
- Understand model limitations and performance trade-offs

This project is designed to reflect a **real-world regression problem** commonly encountered in the automotive and e-commerce industries.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes various attributes related to cars, such as:
- Car specifications
- Engine and performance details
- Ownership and usage information
- Target variable: **Car Price**

Files used:
- `cars_train.csv` – Training dataset
- `cars_test.csv` – Test dataset

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - Pandas  
  - NumPy  
  - Matplotlib  
  - Seaborn  
  - Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

---

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Understanding & Cleaning
- Inspection of missing values and data types
- Handling inconsistent and invalid entries
- Feature selection and transformation

---

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution analysis of numerical features
- Relationship between features and car price
- Detection of outliers and skewness
- Insights into key price-driving variables

---

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features where required
- Removing redundant or non-informative features

---

### 4. Model Building
- Baseline regression model
- Comparison with advanced regression techniques
- Focus on interpretability and stability

---

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Evaluation using regression metrics such as:
  - R² Score
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Analysis of prediction errors and residuals

---

## Key Insights

- Car price is strongly influenced by a combination of usage, engine capacity, and brand-related factors
- Simple models with proper feature selection can perform competitively
- Data quality and feature relevance impact performance more than model complexity

---

## Limitations & Assumptions

- The dataset represents historical data and may not capture market fluctuations
- External factors such as demand, location, and seasonal trends are not included
- Predictions should be interpreted as estimates, not exact values

---

## Future Improvements

- Incorporating additional real-world features
- Advanced feature engineering
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model deployment using Streamlit or Flask

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a structured approach to solving a regression problem using machine learning, with emphasis on **analytical reasoning, evaluation strategy, and real-world applicability**.
